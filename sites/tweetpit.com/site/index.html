            <p>This is an experiment. Say what you want. A few posts a day are
                randomly selected. The rest are forgotten. From this random set one
                is featured. Help weed out the offensive or profane, and promote the
                interesting by voting on posts from the random set.</p>
            <p>Perhaps a parody of today's social media, with its firehouse of posts.
                You only see ten, but can scream to the wind. A lottery determines what rants
                get through and participants vote on the ten who passed the lottery to
                see what's featured.</p>
            <p>It is a tiny app with minimal dependencies, no identity or cookies.
                <a href="https://github.com/mespr/tweetpit">View source</a>. The rotation rules
                assume a tiny audience, so currently swapping every 30 minutes with ten
                slots that get filled randomly as posts expire.</p>
