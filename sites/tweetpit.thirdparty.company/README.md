This is an experiment in slim social. You can post anything. You have no identity.
However, most posts go nowhere. A random selection is chosen for people to up or
down vote. Every so often the randomly selected post with the most positive reviews
is featured.

Nothing is tracked or recorded aside from the ten randomly selected posts that
expire within a day.

I'm still tweaking the rotation numbers.
